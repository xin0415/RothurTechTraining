OSI Model and TCP/IP Model
    OSI Model
        Open System Interconnection, 7 layer
            - application layer: Http, FTP, SMTP, DNS
            - presentation layer: encryption/decryption
            - session layer: sockets
            - transport layer: TCP and UDP
            - network layer: IP
            - data link layer: format of data
            - physical layer: raw bit
    TCP/IP Model
        - application layer     -   contains application layer, presentation layer, session layer

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
    - client-server model
    - Http Request
        - header/ body
    - Http Response
        - header / body
    - http method:
        get: read                |   safe    |     idempotent      |    cacheable      |            get is safe, so it is cacheable, this setup can be changed
        post: create             | not safe  |  not idempotent     |   not cacheable   |
        put: whole update        | not safe  |     idempotent      |   not cacheable   |
        delete: remove           | not safe  |     idempotent      |   not cacheable   |            is will leave database empty, so it is idempotent
        patch: partial update    | not safe  |  not idempotent (can be) |   not cacheable   |       patch will flexibility, you don't need pass whole object, we can also pass operation {operation:"add", targetField:age} to cause patch is not idempotent
    - http status code
        1xx information         providing some base information
        2xx success
        3xx redirection
        4xx client error
        5xx server error

HTTP advanced
    safe, a http method is safe if it doesn't alter(change) the state of the server
    idempotent: a http method is idempotent if an identical request can be made once or several times in a row
                with the same effect while leaving the server in the same state
                idempotent: send the multiple request, but keep the same status in servers
                create resource in server and adding row into database, that is not idempotent
    cacheable
        - whether response can be cached        - store information in somewhere. can be your local brows or server side(session)

        post request: create a user (2, Mali, CA, 18)
        patch request: {operation: "add", targetField: age}
        id name address age
        (2, Tom, CA, 23)

    http status code
        200 OK
        201 created
        202 Accepted
        204 No content
        307 temporary redirect
        301 moved permanently
        400 bad request
        401 unauthorized
        403 forbidden               user doesn't have permission
        404 not found
        500 internal server error


TCP and UDP,
    TCP - check if receive all the packet       send packets (1-100) to server, but server only receive (1-78,80-100), TCP will resubmit 79 package -lower speed
    UDP - may lost package  - high speed because it doesn't check all the packages are received
    difference
    TCP 3 way handshaking / 4 way handshaking

Session and Cookie
    - Cookie: client side,
    - Session: Server side, implements HttpSession interface


Java Web Application Architecture

Three Tier Architecture
    - controller / Service/ DAO(repository layer)
