Linux command in EC2
sudo -i         - to root user
yum install docker
systemctl start docker      - start docker
systemctl status docker     - to check if it is active
docker images           - check docker image
docker ps               - shows docker container
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:lts      - download and run jenkins image
pwd                     - current path
rm fileName             - remove file
nohup java -jar filename.ar &       - start jar application

create Jenkins pipeline
Jenkins -> Pipeline
    build triggers -> build periodically to setup build schedule
                   -> github hook trigger for GITScm polling -> any user push code into git, Jenkins will triggers to build the code from git
SCM means source control manage
Pipeline definition can be put into the git or write script
    put stage('xxx'){steps{echo 'mean print'}} inside stages
after create pipeline -> click build now to build the application

1. Environment
	Dev Env
		developer, very frequently
	Test Env/Integration Env
		integration test, penetration test
		Tester, BA, Productor Manager
		maybe two weeks
	User Acceptance Test (UAT)/ Staging/ Pre-prod
		internal network
		deploy period month
	Producet Env: public network
		release, deploy period month

2 CICD pipeline
    CD when you have new feature in github, release new feature to the environment directly
	jenkins
	Jenkinsfile

3. Monitor
	Prometheus Server       - to monitor Spring Actuator and Expoter
	Grafana Server          - get the data from Prometheus for display, provide dashboard - user will access here to check status - it provide Alert manager
	Spring Actuator         - to monitor servers status
	Expoter /metrics        - to monitor database status

4. Agile
	Team title
		BA, QA, DBA, DevOps, Developer
		TL, Architect, Manager
	Agile tile
		Scrum Master 
		Product Owner

	BA: collect all the requirement from customers and tell all teh requirement to developer team, communication between developer and customers.
	QA (Quality Assurance): tester
	DBA (database admin): we cannot setup the database by ourself, we need told to DBA
	DevOps: to handle CICD pipeline
	Developer:
	TL （tech leader) or Architect: usually TL will handle the architect
	manager: product manager

	Scrum Master: lead the process of meeting
	Product Owner: who own the project (who pay the money)


	Agile methodology
		sprint planning
		sprint review
		Sprint retrospective 
		Daily standup meeting

    Product Backlog is environment, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product and includes the Product Goal
    Sprint Planning is sprint goal, and what features need to complete
    Sprint review do presentation what you have done
	Backlog will put all the tasks that require to complete

	waterfall methodology
	Requirements -> Design -> implementation -> verification -> maintenance
		
	Jira

	story points
		1 point = 2 hours
		If one sprint is one week -> 40 hours, -> 16 points, 32 hours, some margin
	
	Fibonacci
	1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
	13 very big story
		-> 5 + 3 + 5

	team size < = 10


Source -> Branch Protection -> Linting -> build -> building image compiling code -> container image -> unit tests -? Code Coverage Check 80-90% (unit tests for 80 or 90% of code)
PR before developer can merge code into main branch
Linting check
then move to build stage
