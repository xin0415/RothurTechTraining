 1. Docker
 We can use Docker to make code to run everywhere. easy to start up.
	docker vs VM
	Dockerfile -> docker image -> docker container
	Docker Architecture
		Docker engine
		docker client               you can send all the message to docker engine. for example, docker build to build docker image.
		docker registries           you can your local registries, the default public registries is docker hub. you can also have private docker registries

	docker deployment and orchestration
		docker plugins
		docker compose
		docker swarm
		k8s     kubernetes

2 AWS
	see AWS slides
	auto-scaling is when a server(EC2) is down, it automatically generate a new server to replace the down server
	EC2 automatically add or remove EC2 instances in response to changing application demand
	Elastic load balancing is load balancer
	API gateway can also work as load balancer
	AWS SNS is Simple Notification Service  - SNS can notify SQS
	AWS SQS is Simple Queue Service
	AWS Cloud watch to monitor the budget
	AWS ECS supports docker containers
	AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service(EKS) used to run Kubernetes
	AWS Fargate to deploy the docker
	AWS ACL (ACLs) (used for subnet) Network access control lists is virtual firewall that control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level and used to security the subnet (placed in front of subnet) to define who can access this subnet
	AWS security groups (used for EC2 instance) is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an amazon EC2 instance
	AWS DynamoDB is noSQL database
	AWS ElastiCache used for cache
	IAM user can have different user for AWS account, for development team
	IAM group can assign users, each group have different permission
	IAM roles assign permission to application, for example, assign role for EC2 instance
	IAM policies to define the policies and permission
	CloudWatch is dashboard to monitor all the AWS usage


VM:
Your need to implement all the memory, storage, core, etc. You need to setup everything for below layers. Also, VM need the guest OS in order to use them
App: application
Bins/Libs: make OS works
Guest OS: can be any OS
Hypervisor: used to generate different VM
Host OS: different operation system: mac, windows, linux, redhat, ubuntu
infrastructure: most basic

Docker:
all the application will share whole operation system. We don't need predefine how many resource is used for each container
-------------
|    App:    |
| Bins/Libs: |       = container
-------------
Docker Engine: host containers
Host OS: different operation system: mac, windows, linux, redhat, ubuntu
infrastructure: most basic

docker images                                   - to check docker image in your pc
docker pull hellow-world                        - to get the image "hello-world" from docker hub - it will check local repository if you have this image. if cannot find in local, it will get the image from docker hub https://hub.docker.com/
docker run hello-world                          - run the docker image
docker ps                                       - show all the container running in our operation
docker ps -a                                    - to show all the details of container and image

terminal will use dockerfile to generate docker image and container

docker engine
                docker daemon
      container             image                       registry    - all the images in manage by the registry or call it docker repository
      container             image
      container             image
